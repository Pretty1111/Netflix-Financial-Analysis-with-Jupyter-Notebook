## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook project provides an in-depth financial analysis of Netflix, focusing on revenue trends and regional revenue distribution from 2012 to 2023. The project aims to uncover insights from the data and provide valuable information for decision-making and strategic planning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
To run the Jupyter Notebook and view the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP.
2. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the location where you cloned or extracted the repository.
4. Open the "Netflix_Financial_Analysis.ipynb" file to view the analysis.

## Data Sources
The financial data used in this analysis was sourced from the Kaggle dataset "Netflix OTT Revenue and Subscribers (CSV File)" provided by SHIVAM MAURYA. The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-original-films-imdb-ratings).

## Project Overview
The Jupyter Notebook contains the following key sections:

1. Total Revenue per Year and per Quarter: Analysis of Netflix's quarterly and yearly revenue trends, identifying growth patterns and fluctuations.
2. Revenue for Each Region from 2019 to 2023: Examination of revenue data for the UACN, EMEA, LATM, and APAC regions, highlighting any significant changes over the specified period.

4. Key Findings and Insights.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into Netflix's financial performance, indicating consistent revenue growth and significant shifts in regional revenue contributions. The findings can guide strategic decision-making for future growth and expansion strategies.

Please note that this analysis is based on the available data up to 2023's first quarter, and additional data would be required to assess the complete trend.
